    To use this, dataset_root should be the path to the HDF5 file, or alternatively
    a semicolon separated list of multiple files.  Each group in the file contains
    samples that all have the same number of atoms.  Typically there is one
    group for each unique number of atoms, but that is not required.  Each group
    should contain arrays called "types" (atom type indices), "pos" (atom positions),
    and "energy" (the energy of each sample).  It may optionally include an array
    called "forces" (the force on each atom).
